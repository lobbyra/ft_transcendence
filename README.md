## Subject

### The project

This project 42-school project is about to discover notions that we never heard about before.
The goal is to be lost in new notions to improve learning skills.

### Presentation

This is a website where you can play pong with other players.
There are accounts, a chat, spectating mode and a match-making system. You can also customize the game by
changing the background and add power-ups.

### Technical details

This project is fully coded in Typescript and could be deployed simply with docker-compose.

- For the front framework, we choose VueJS. There are many different frameworks but this project looked good to us. Above Vue, we added NuxtJS to simplify our development.
- For the back framework, NestJS was imposed.
- Finally, Postgres was imposed too.

If you are more curious, you could find our Notion documentation bellow.

### Usage

To start this project, you have to use the command `docker-compose up --build`.

⚠ 42 authentication will not work because you need API keys.
⚠ This is a student project, some things could be outdated.
